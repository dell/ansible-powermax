-   Create volumes, storage groups, hosts, host groups, port groups,
    masking views, Metro DR environments, snapshot policies,
    and snapshots of a storage group.

    port groups, masking views, Metro DR environments, Job, RDF groups, 
    snapshot policies, storage pools, initiators and snapshots of a storage group.

New Features and Enhancements
---------------------------

The Ansible modules for Dell PowerMax release has the following
changes:
- Added Unisphere port parameter.
- Added support for restoration of storage group from a snapshot using Snapshot module.

> **NOTE:** Unisphere Version 9.1 is compatible with PowerMax Python
> library version 9.1.x.x and similarly Unisphere versions later than 9.1 will
> only work with Python library versions later than 9.1.x.x.

Known issues
------------
- When the user tries to create a host with invalid initiators using automation, an empty host is created despite generating an error. However, when a modify scenario is run on this host without a pause, it generates an error saying "The requested host resource already exists.". A workaround is to add a pause(~20) between the two tasks.

Limitations
-----------
There are no known limitations.
