# Branching strategy

Ansible modules for Dell PowerMax follows a scaled trunk branching strategy where short-lived branches are created off of the main branch. When coding is complete, the branch is merged back into main after being approved in a pull request code review.

## Branch naming convention

| Branch Type | Example                         |  Comment                                  |
|-------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| main        | main                            |                                           |
| Release     | release-1.0                     |  hotfix: release-1.1 patch: release-1.0.1 |
| Feature     | feature-9-vol-support           |  "9" referring to GitHub issue ID         |
| Bug Fix     | bugfix-110-fix-duplicates-issue |  "110" referring to GitHub issue ID       |


## Steps for working on a release branch

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch from the main branch. The branch name should follow [branch naming convention](#branch-naming-convention).
3. Make your changes and commit them to your branch.
4. If other code changes have merged into the upstream main branch, perform a rebase of those changes into your branch.
5. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/dell/ansible-powermax/pulls) between your branch and the upstream main branch.
6. Once your pull request has merged, can delete your branch.
